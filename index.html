        <h3 class="text-center text-underlined">Inspiration and Improvement
        </h3>
        <p class="text-center">To build on and improve my existing personal homepage I drew inspiration from <a href="https://cssmix.net/showcase/11329/joo-hwansun">this page.</a> I liked the use of the grid style photo gallery. However, I then needed to find a way to display my text. I liked the idea of being able to click on the images to show a larger version of them along with a caption.
          
<br/>To implement this on my own homepage I looked at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp">a modal tutorial</a> on w3 Schools and an <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-image-gallery-with-css-grid-e0f0fd666a5c/">image gallery tutorial</a> on freeCodeCamp.<br />The most challenging parts of this were getting my modals to work with more than one image and getting the text to display within the modals themselves. I looked at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47798971/several-modal-images-on-page">a post</a> on Stack Overflow to resolve this. Overall, I am pleased with the updates I have made and I have gained some familiarity with JavaScript.</p>
